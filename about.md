## About Tony

I'm an ethical hacker and bug bounty hunter focused on **recon**, **OSINT**, and **open-source security tools**.  
I share what I learn to help others grow, and I keep my work grounded in **trust, integrity, morals, and ethics (TIME)**.

**What I do**
- Build and publish recon tools & scripts
- Write practical tutorials and workflows
- Explore security research in public
